# Humans
A bug tracker for what is arguably one of the buggiest creatures this side of bugs.

## Your feedback is welcome!
Please share your experiences with "human"!

To contribute to this project, please file new issues or comment on existing ones to add more context.  Links to relevant external documentation is appreciated.

Note that all pull requests to this project will be declined, as the implementation backlog is considered a trade secret.  While we will do everything we can to respond to your feedback, we unfortunately cannot guarantee when or even if we will be able to address your thoughts or concerns.

Thank you for being human!
